## What is FinOps Open Cost & Usage Specification (FOCUS)?

FOCUS is a community specification that works to define and maintain a common, source-neutral, schema and related artifacts for cloud billing, cost, usage, and observability data with mappings to cloud service provider billing data and other common sources of cost and usage data. FOCUS enables organizations to ingest and normalize cloud and related billing data in a way that is compatible with FinOps practices, KPIs and the FinOps Framework. This project is sponsored and maintained by the [FinOps Foundation](https://www.finops.org).

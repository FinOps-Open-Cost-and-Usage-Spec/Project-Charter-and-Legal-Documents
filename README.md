## What is FinOps Open Cost & Usage Specification (FOCUS)?

FOCUS is a community specification that works to establish an open standard for cloud billing data. It specifies vendor neutral cross-cloud measures for key cost & usage dimensions/metrics. These measures and their derivations establish a baseline schema that enables cloud billing data to be surfaced in a common FinOps-serviceable format. This project is sponsored and maintained by the [FinOps Foundation](https://www.finops.org).

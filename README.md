## Contributing to FOCUS repositories

All of the FOCUS repositories are managed by EasyCLA. Project participants must sign the free ([FOCUS Membership agreement](https://preview-spec-membership.finops.org) **TODO: get URL** before making a contribution. You only need to do this one time, and it can be signed by [individual contributors](http://individual-spec-membership.finops.org/) or their [employers](http://corporate-spec-membership.finops.org/) **TODO: get URL** .

To initiate the signature process please open a PR against the [EasyCLA repo](https://github.com/FinOps-Open-Cost-and-Usage-Spec/EasyCLA). The EasyCLA bot will block the merge if we still need a membership agreement from you.

If you have issues, please email [operations@finops.org](mailto:operations@finops.org) **TODO: get email **.

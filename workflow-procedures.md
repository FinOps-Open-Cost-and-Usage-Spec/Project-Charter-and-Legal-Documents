1. **Work Item Creation:** Propose and define the scope and objectives of a new specification.
2. **Specification Development:** Draft and refine technical content to ensure the specification meets its intended goals.
3. **Consistency, IPR Review:** Review the draft for coherence, intellectual property rights compliance, and alignment with the defined scope.
4. **Final Specification Working Group Approval:** Validate the specification against technical and quality standards set by the working group.
5. **Steering Committee Ratification:** Obtain higher-level oversight and approval for public release from the steering committee.
6. **Technical Specification Publication:** Officially publish and release the specification with a version number for stakeholder implementation.

### Work Item Creation Phase
The below diagram illustrates the Work Item Creation phase, which is the first stage in the Specifications Lifecycle for the FinOps FOCUS project. The main purpose of this phase is to define and refine the scope for the next FOCUS release, such as e.g. v1.2, ensuring that all proposed work items align with strategic priorities and are well-documented and actionable.

#### Key Steps in Scope Definition:

1. **Ideation and Intake:** The process begins by capturing a variety of inputs, including bugs, use cases, discussion documents, pull requests (PRs), and spreadsheets. These inputs serve as the foundation for new Work Item Issues, which are documented using a standardized template to ensure consistency across all submissions.

2. **Work Item Issue Documentation:** For each potential work item, a Work Item Issue is created with mandatory information, such as a title, problem statement, and relevant supporting documents (e.g., data examples, or epics for consideration). This documentation provides the initial structure and context for each proposal, making it easier to assess relevance to the release scope.

3. **Triage and Theming:** The Maintainers and the Steering Committee (SC) review each Work Item Issue to evaluate alignment with high-level FinOps themes and release priorities. This triage step is critical for categorizing and prioritizing items, helping to shape the initial scope for the upcoming release by filtering out items that do not align with current goals.

4. **Elaboration and Input:** Items that pass the triage are moved to the Elaboration phase, where additional supporting documents are prepared, and each item is assigned to relevant epics. Stakeholders provide input to further clarify requirements and validate that each work item aligns with both technical and business objectives, ensuring it is relevant to the intended scope for the release.

5. **Requirements Documentation:** After elaboration, a Requirements Document is created for all the work items. This document details essential information, including the estimated effort level and priority, collaboratively determined by both stakeholders and maintainers. This formalized documentation helps clarify expectations and ensures that all necessary information is captured to support the itemâ€™s inclusion in the upcoming release.

6. **Epic Assignment and Steering Committee Ratification:** Completed requirements are grouped into epics and presented to the Steering Committee for review. Through ratification, the committee finalizes which epics and associated work items will be included in the scope for the targeted release version, such as e.g., v1.2.


### Review & Approval Process
This diagram depicts the Review & Approval process. 

It highlights:
* Any objection SHOULD be submitted together with a rational artifact (Pull Request or Issue proposal)
* In case of Technical Vote: 
  * Only Steering & General Members can vote in a Supermajority vote.
  * A Supermajority type of vote is required to resolve technical disputes. 
    * This means that only the Steering Committee and General members can vote.
